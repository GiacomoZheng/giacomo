# gm

my source gmfile

**the folder names** are the true name of the `.gm` file in it.

the names start with `_` is the ones uncompleted up to now.

## about the better comment
* `; *` is equal to `; NOTE`, meaning it is important.
* `; +` is equal to `; TODO`, meaning I'll add something or complete here later.
* `; ?` is equal to `; WAIT`, meaning I haven't determined about whether I'll keep on use it.
* `; !` is equal to `; WARN`, meaning it is something wrong here, and I'll fix it later
