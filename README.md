Go to the [tutorials](https://github.com/GiacomoZheng/gm/wiki)

**the folder names** are the true name of the `.gm` file in it, like `group/.gm` is the definition of group.

The names start with `_` is the ones may be deleted or renamed later.

The folder `h` is the entry of the whole file

The file `.tree` is the menu of the whole file

## about the better comment
* `; *` is equal to `; NOTE`, meaning it is important.
* `; +` is equal to `; TODO`, meaning I'll add something or complete here later.
* `; ?` is equal to `; WAIT`, meaning I haven't determined about whether I'll keep on use it.
* `; !` is equal to `; WARN`, meaning it is something wrong here, and I'll fix it later

## TODO
* delete all the `|â€¦|`
* adjust all the
    - Hom
    - End
    - Aut
* adjust relation into generaler function 


## some "high order class", "class of classes"
    (these are not really `gm` concepts, but something like "universal property" or "isomorphic theorem", I'll list some intutive properties below)
* (mathematic) structure: a set with some additional mathematical object, like [`topology`](./h/_/topological_space/.gm), [`relation`](./h/relation/.gm) or [`operator`](./h/operator/.gm).
    - examples: [`topological_space`](./h/_/topological_space/.gm), [`poset`](./h/_/poset/.gm) and [`group`](./h/_/group/.gm).
* space: a set where all the elements can be regrad as points, or atoms (meaning "indivisible").
    - examples: [`topological_space`](./h/_/topological_space/.gm), [`vector_space`](./h/_/vector_space/.gm), [`metric_space`](./h/_/metric_space/.gm).
