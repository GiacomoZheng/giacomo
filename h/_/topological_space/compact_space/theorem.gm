; for compact space

s"criterion of compact subset":
(
	∀X: ∈ topological_space,
	∀A: ⊆ X,
	(
		∀𝒰: ⊆ X.open_cover(A), ∃𝒰': (⊆ 𝒰, |𝒰'| ∈ ℕ), A ⊆ ∪(𝒰')
	)
	⇒ A ∈ compact_space
),
[ proof```

``` ]

s"finite space are always compact",

s"closed subsets of a compact space are compact as well":
(
	∀X: ∈ compact_space,
	X.closed ⊆ compact_sub(X)
),
[ proof```

``` ]

s"image of continous function on a compact set is compact":
(
	∀f: ∈ continuous_function,
	∀A: ⊆ f.D,
	A ∈ compact_space ⇒ f.image(A) ∈ compact_space
),
[ proof```
	X: = f.D,
	∃I: ∈ set, ∃U[∀i: ∈ I]: ∈ X.τ, f(A) ⊆ ∪[∀i: ∈ I](U[i]),
	[ so that ] A ⊆ ∪[∀i: ∈ I](f.preimage(U[i])),
``` ]

s"product of two compact sets are still compact, verse vice":
(

),
[ proof```
	; ⇐ : X×Y compact ⇒ X, Y compact
	p[X]: (x,y) ↦ x, ∀(p[X] ∈ continuous_function, X×Y ∈ compact_space) ⇒ X = p[X](X×Y) ∈ compact_space
