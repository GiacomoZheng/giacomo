s"the group homomorphism on two vector space": ; +
(
	∀A: ∈ vector_space, ∀B: ∈ vector_space,
	∀f: (∈ group.homomorphism, f.D = A, f.C = B),
	; we can see that the corresponding field of A and B may be different
	[ we can have a try```
		@f,
		f(a + a) = f(a) + f(a),
		f(D.F.1 × a) = 
		■
	``` ]
	; ! .... I don't know
