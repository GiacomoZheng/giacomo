: ; cover
(
	[ type ]
	⊆ set,

	[ axioms and datafield ]
	∀𝒞: ∈ cover,
	𝒞.D: ∈ set,
	; this sentence means, every sample of cover has a set with it, I call it domain,
	; other names like original set, the whole set showing similar ideas

	∀C: ∈ 𝒞, C ⊆ 𝒞.D, ; every element of the cover should be a subset of the domain of it
	𝒞.D = ∪[](𝒞) ; + the union of all the sets in the cover should be the domain
